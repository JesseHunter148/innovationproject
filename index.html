    <p style = "color:white">5G is the 5th generation cellular network technology that creates bigger channels <br>
        and lowers latency, opening up the door to many more options beyond a faster <br>
        connection for our web browsing and Tv streaming needs. </p>

    <header style = "color:white"><b>How could this help us?</b></header>

    <p style = "color:white">The lower latency rates, faster speeds, and ability to connect to more devices <br>
        makes many new ideas possible. Self driving cars could communicate with each other <br>
        on the road to increase safety, factory robots could become more efficient, farmers <br>
        could use drones to water and plant new crops, and emergency services can connect and<br>
        use new technology possible with 5G.</p>
