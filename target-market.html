    <p style = "color: white;">The many emergency services we have set up in our country would take advantage of this technology, the ambulance have <br>
        many used for the technology, firefighters would get drones to scout out and put out fires without risking human life, and <br>
        first responders would use drones to find survivors faster and get the necessary supplies to them easier. Overall if they are <br>
        all on the same network they can be organized and keep track of what's going on and the information they need to complete their <br>
        jobs with the most efficiency. </p>

    <header style = "color: white;">Where?</header>

    <p style = "color: white;">Emergency services across the country and the government funding behind them would pay for these upgrades. If agencies <br>
        across the nation get these upgrades everyone could be better connected.</p>
