<header style = "color:white"><b>Ambulance</b></header>

<p style = "color:white">The new 5G rollout could equip ambulance with more powerful equipment, such as high definition video communication, computed <br>
   tomography, as well as X rayâ€™s that would all be connected the computer inside the vehicle as well as the hospital the ambulance<br>
   is going to giving everyone at every step of the process all the information which could lead to more lives being saved. The 5G <br>
   connections would also allow off-scene doctors to give their diagnostics through the HD video communications.</p>

<header style = "color:white"><b>Firefighters</b></header>

<p style = "color:white">The firefighters could use 5G to better control and receive information using drones, they could be used to look into fires as <br>
   well as natural disasters to look for survivors a lot faster than a team of first responders could, this would not only save time <br>
   but save the risk of human life and potentially save more lives with the faster rates of finding and getting to the survivors. Not only <br>
   could it be used to find survivors, it could be used to drop off medical supplies to survivors minimizing the risk of human error and <br>
   getting it to them much faster.</p>

<header style="color:white"><b>Self driving cars</b></header>

<p style = "color:white">The vehicles emergency services use could also be automated to drive themselves along with how the rest of the cars might be after 5G. <br>
    Due to the ability to connect to more devices 5G could make self driving cars all connect to each other and communicate making it <br>
    safer and potentially easier if they are communicating with the ambulance so the EMS can get where they need to go as fast as possible.</p>

<header style="color:white"><b>Overall</b></header>

<p style = "color:white">With 5G emergency services could also just respond faster and be more coordinated among them all so response times could much faster<br>
   and more organized getting people the hell they need faster and safer.</p>
